This is a R Markdown document decribing the codebook of the dataset XSel2 resulting from the analysis of the Course Project of the 'Getting & Cleaning Data' course. This result is based on the R script 'run_analysis.R'.

This dataset is obtained after merging the training and test datasets, only retaining the variables related to means and standard deviations. This dataset is further the result of the aggregation of all values of the same subject and activity by their mean (averaged).
This results in the dataset named XSel2 with 180 rows [30 volunteers * 6 activities], and with 79 variables (columns). The first two colums in this dataset are reserved for the subject id-number [1-30] and the label for the six activities [WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING].
